# synergy_toggle
This repo produces little macOS Apps to disable and reenable Symless Synergy 2.0.x in macOS. This will be obsolete after Synergy 2.1, which will likely come in Q3 2018.


## Note 

Unfortunately I could not get these Apps to be pretty, because of Problems with plist file. 
But they work otherwise. :)
